- IEB* Utilities
	- IEB prefix comes from the original name of the program library: "Input/Output Exit and Buffer"
		- src: ChatGPT
			- > The prefix "IEB" in the names of the IBM Mainframe utilities such as IEBGENER, IEBEDIT, IEBUPDTE, IEBPTP, IEBDG, IEBCOMPR, IEBTEST, etc. stands for "IEB Supersede".
			  >
			  > The "IEB" prefix comes from the original name of the program library that contained these utilities: the Input/Output (I/O) Exit and Buffer (IEB) module library. The IEB module library was a collection of system programs and utilities that provided I/O and buffer management functions for IBM's early operating systems, including OS/360 and its successors.
			  >
			  > Over time, the IEB utilities became widely used and were included in later versions of the operating system. Today, many of these utilities remain in use on z/OS and continue to be prefixed with "IEB" for historical reasons.
